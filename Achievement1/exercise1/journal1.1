Exercise 1.1: Getting Started with Python 
Learning Goals

●	Summarize the uses and benefits of Python for web development
●	Prepare your developer environment for programming with Python

Reflection Questions

1.	In your own words, what is the difference between frontend and backend web development? If you were hired to work on backend programming for a web application, what kinds of operations would you be working on?
    
    The difference comes down to structure and purpose.  The front end is built with the intention of creating a visual and interactive experience for the user, while the back end provides the functionality and logic behind the application.  For instance, the backend would feature database storage and configuration as well as security measures to protect proprietary information.

2.	Imagine you’re working as a full-stack developer in the near future. Your team is asking for your advice on whether to use JavaScript or Python for a project, and you think Python would be the better choice. How would you explain the similarities and differences between the two languages to your team? Drawing from what you learned in this Exercise, what reasons would you give to convince your team that Python is the better option? 
(Hint: refer to the Exercise section “The Benefits of Developing with Python”)

    In this scenario, I would provide data supporting Python as the most user-friendly approach due to its readability and flexibility related to its Dynamic Typing features.  It comes down to ease of doing business for all parties involved.  With features like Built-in-Packaging management, Python allows its developers to utilize automated functions, ultimately allowing for speedier and more precise web development. 

3.	Now that you’ve had an introduction to Python, write down 3 goals you have for yourself and your learning during this Achievement. You can reflect on the following questions if it helps you. What do you want to learn about Python? What do you want to get out of this Achievement? Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?
    
    > I want to understand the structure of virtual environments more
    > I want to explore more built-in-packaging options and understand their practical uses
    > I want to understand how to work on database management with Python
